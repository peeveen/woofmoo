# The bastards at Google "sunsetted" (i.e. killed off) Conversational Actions in June 2023, removing any potential for hobbyist applications running on their smart speakers. In fact, as of 23rd May 2023, their speakers started thinking that the "Talk To Woof Moo" command was a request to play the sound of barking dogs, so they have effectively killed them off before the stated date. In short, this app no longer works.
